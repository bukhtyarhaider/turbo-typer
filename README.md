## 🎯 What is this MAGNIFICENT CHAOS?

Picture this: You're sitting there, utterly **BORED** 😴, watching AI and agentic coding turn your once-mighty typing skills into absolute *garbage* 🗑️. What do you do? **YOU BUILD A TYPING GAME WHERE YOUR CAR CRASHES EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A TYPO!** 

That's right, folks! This is **Turbo Typer: Comic Edition** - the most wonderfully ridiculous typing game where:

- ⚡ Your WPM literally powers your car (type fast = ZOOM! 🚗💨)
- 🪨 Every typo spawns an obstacle (because pain is the best teacher)
- 🎮 It's got comic-book style graphics (KAPOW! BAM! WHOOSH!)
- 🛡️ Power-ups and shields (because even chaos needs balance)
- 🏆 High scores (for when you want to flex your typing supremacy)

## 🚀 Quick Start (GET IN THE GAME!)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js (and a sense of humor) 🤡

1. **Clone this beautiful disaster:**
   ```bash
   git clone [this-repo]
   cd "Turbo Typer | Comic"
   ```

2. **Install the magic:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **FIRE UP THE ENGINES:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open `http://localhost:5173` and prepare for CHAOS!** 🎮

## 🎮 How to Play (AKA How to Suffer Beautifully)

1. **Choose your difficulty** (Easy = gentle suffering, Hard = pure masochism)
2. **Start typing the text** - your car moves based on your WPM
3. **Don't make typos** - they spawn obstacles that slow you down!
4. **Collect power-ups** - shields protect you, nitro boosts speed
5. **Reach 100% to win** - or crash and cry (both valid outcomes)

### 🎯 Pro Tips for Maximum Fun:
- **Type like your life depends on it** (because your car's life does)
- **Typos are the enemy** (but also hilarious when they happen)
- **Power-ups are your friends** (collect them like you're playing Sonic)
- **The difficulty slope literally changes the road angle** (physics!)

## 🎪 Why This Exists (The Origin Story)

Once upon a time, there was a developer who was:
1. **Bored AF** 😴
2. **Watching AI tools make their typing worse** 🤖➡️💩
3. **Missing the good old days of actually typing code** 😢

So they thought: *"What if I made a game where bad typing literally crashes a car?"*

And thus, **Turbo Typer: Comic Edition** was born - a beautiful monument to the absurdity of modern development and the eternal struggle between humans and keyboards.
